# TO DO LIST
1. Fittig line in PTC read+shot noise vs signal variance
   - plot equation in text
2. Refactore plotiing noises
     - when to display m=1 and m=1/2 fits
     - when to display zones
     - Display FPC noise vs Signal (non log) => estoimate p by LS fitting
3. Estoimate Quantum yield ?
4. Dark current PTCs
5. Spectral Response from images and phoytodiode readings (with its readout noise)
