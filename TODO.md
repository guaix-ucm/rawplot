# TO DO LIST
1. New rawplot-bias with commands to:
	* create a master bias
		- Calculate the pixel average (master bias) and save as 3D FITS 
		- Calculate the pixel stddev (master stdev) and save as 3D FITS 
		- Calculate the max pixel value (master max) and save as 3D FITS 
	* display a FITS image (the master bias, stde or max)

2. Continue with PTC curves to estimate readount noise, FWC, etc.
3. from log2 to log10 for displays?
4. from `(R G1 G2 B)` to `(R Gr Gb B)` ?
	* Update doc images as well
